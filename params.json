{"name":"Kylo - the browser for TV","body":"Welcome to the Kylo Browser source code!\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nKylo is a web browser based on Mozilla's Gecko SDK for use on computers \r\nconnected to TVs. \r\n\r\nKylo's on-screen controls are intended to be viewable from about 10 feet away from a 32\" or greater HDTV screen running at 720 or higher resolution. Kylo was originally designed as companion software to the Loop&trade; in-air motion pointer from [Hillcrest Labs](http://hillcrestlabs.com). Navigation is done primarily through pointer control, such as with a motion controller (ie. [WarpiaTV](http://www.warpia.com/products/warpiatv-swp500)) or a mouse. Some work has been done to allow control with a standard Up/Down/Left/Right remote control.\r\n\r\n__Some helpful documents:__  \r\n\r\n- directory_map.txt  \r\nThis file describes the basic outline of the Kylo source code directory structure.\r\n\r\n- build_instructions.txt  \r\nBasic documentation of the Kylo build process.\r\n\r\n- LICENSE  \r\nLawyer stuff.
